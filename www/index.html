			<h2>Characteristics of Living Things</h2>
			<p>
				Organisms are living things<br>
				<big>1. Celluar Organization</big><br>
				A cell is the basic unit of structure and function in a organism<br>
				<big>Types of Cell Stucture</big>
				Unicellular = An organism made up of <b>only 1 cell</b>. <br>
				Multicellular = An organism made up of <b>MANY CELLS</b> <br>
				<big>2. Energy Use</big><br>
				All organisms use energy. Some ways they use energy are eating, moving, hunting, etc. The sun is the source of energy for all organisms. Plants use the process of photosynthisis to convert sunlight into energy. Watch the video to learn more!

				<big>3. Growth & Development</big><br>
				Growth: <br>
				Growth is when organisms get larger in size by creating new cells <br>
				Development: <br>
				This is when an organism changes during an organism's life to become a more complex organism.

				<big>4. Response to Stimulus</big><br>
				The things that organisms react to are called stimuli or stimulus.
				All organisms must mantain homeostasis to stay alive. To mantain homeostasis an organism must react to internal stimuli.

			This praire dog is reacting to seeing a rattlesnake. The rattlesnake's presence is the stimulus.
			<big>5. Simular Chemical Make Up</big><br>
			Organisms are made up of mostly the same chemicals, such as water and carbon.<br>
			<big>6. Reproduction</big>
			Reproduction is when organisms create new organisms. If reproduction did not happen, there would be no life on earth. There are two forms of reproduction: <br>
			Asexual = <b>Only one organism</b> is needed to reproduce <br>
			Sexual = <b>TWO ORGANISMS</b> are needed to reproduce<br>
